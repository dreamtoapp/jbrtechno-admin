# organizational-structure actions

Server actions used **only** by the `app/[locale]/admin/organizational-structure` route.

- Define route-specific server actions here and import them into `page.tsx` or local components.
- If an action becomes shared across multiple routes, move it to the global `actions/` folder and import it from there.
